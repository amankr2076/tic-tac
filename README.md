# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. Here's how it works:

## Objective:
The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols (either X or O).

### Setup:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- One player chooses X, and the other chooses O.
- Players take turns placing their symbol in one of the empty squares.

### Rules:
- Players alternate turns, with the first player usually being X.
- On their turn, a player places their symbol (X or O) in any empty square on the grid.
- The game is won by the first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all nine squares are filled without any player forming a line of three, the game is considered a draw or tie.

### Strategy:
- A common strategy is to take the center square, as it gives the most options to form a line.
- Blocking your opponent's attempts to form a line is crucial.
- Players should always be thinking ahead, anticipating their opponentâ€™s next move.
- Tic Tac Toe is a great example of a game that can be solved, meaning if both players play optimally, the game will always end in a draw.
